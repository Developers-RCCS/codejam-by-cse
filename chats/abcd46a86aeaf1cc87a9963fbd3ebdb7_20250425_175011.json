It involved a shift from manual labor to machine-based production of goods.\n\nInitially confined to Britain for about 50 years, its influence rapidly spread across Europe and the rest of the world during the 1800s, primarily driven by trade and colonization.  This expansion involved both the application of new technologies to different sectors (like transportation, communication, and agriculture) and the adoption of industrial methods in other countries.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the Industrial Revolution's emergence in Britain. These included:  a burgeoning wealthy class capable of industrial investment,  rapid population growth increasing demand for goods, advancements in scientific knowledge stemming from the Renaissance, readily available resources like iron, steel, and coal, and a politically stable environment with government support for business. Britain's geographic advantages\u2014a small island nation with easily accessible markets\u2014also played a role.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution had profound consequences, both positive and negative. Positively, it led to increased production, new job opportunities in cities, improved living standards for some, and advancements in transportation and communication (like the steam engine, the telegraph, and the telephone). Negatively, it resulted in severe social inequalities, environmental pollution, and harsh working conditions for the laboring class, leading to social unrest, the rise of labor unions, and new political ideologies such as socialism and liberalism.  In short, the Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped the world."}]

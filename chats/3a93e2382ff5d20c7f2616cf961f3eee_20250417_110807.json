It originated in Europe but quickly spread to European colonies and eventually involved the United States, becoming a truly global war spanning all continents.  Several factors contributed to its outbreak, including:\n\n* **Rivalry between France and Germany:**  Stemming from the unification of Germany in 1870 and subsequent conflict with France.  This created long-standing animosity.\n* **Competition for armaments and colonies:**  A powerful arms race and fierce competition for colonies in Asia and Africa fueled tensions between major European powers (Britain, Germany, France, Russia).\n* **The behaviour of the German Emperor, William II:** His aggressive pursuit of a German empire through colonization created suspicion and hostility amongst other nations.\n* **Assassination of Austria's heir to the throne:** The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo acted as the immediate trigger for the war.  Austria's declaration of war on Serbia led to a chain reaction of alliances, drawing in other nations.\n\n\nThe war resulted in massive loss of life and wealth, widespread devastation, and the collapse of several empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman).  The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, aimed to establish peace but also imposed harsh penalties on Germany, which would contribute to the rise of World War II.  The war also led to the creation of the League of Nations, an international organization intended to prevent future conflicts\u2014though ultimately unsuccessful."}]
